## Usage

These tools are used in the source code of the [Goolge Chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/reabr/foekanecjajkibjpcppepmnkofmcnjhc) application [Reabr online bookmark manager](https://www.reabr.com).

Here, they ensure convenient highlighting of text in HTML pages and its subsequent saving using a text fragment in the Reabr application. Using the embedded entry in the application, it is possible to recall the highlighted text using a special fragment.
